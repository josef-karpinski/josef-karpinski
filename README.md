# My Projects

## [Connect 4](https://github.com/josef-karpinski/Connect-4-with-Processing)
This was my first ever program that I worked on from ideation to creation. This project was developed as a final project for my AP Computer Science A class. The goal was to create a full game from scratch using Processing.org's Java library. I decided to create a fully-functioning and animated version of the all-time classic board game. This project developed my skills in OOP and Java, and overall drived my passion for programming.

## Circlegame
Circlegame is an aim training video game that myself and manos-alex created as an extension to the skills we learned in our AP Computer Science A class. We developed the entire game from scratch, colloborating on what features we desired and finally implementing those features using our programming skills. In addition, we developed Circlegame's very own webpage where anybody can download and enjoy our creation. This project developed my skills in various different areas, most notably my problem solving, colloboration skills, Java, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. 

## [ValoScout](https://github.com/josef-karpinski/ValoScout)
Valoscout is a Python program that I developed that can be used to scout semi-proffesional teams in Riot Games' first person shooter, VALORANT. This program utilizes the Riot Games Devloper API and analyzes the perfomance of any team of 5 players that you desire. This program gave me my first experience with utilizing API's and is one that my school's team is able to utilize.

## Quizlet to PDF
This is a project that I am currently working on. I am developing a google chrome extension where users can turn online quizlet flashcard sets into print-friendly PDFs, where they can then print out and use physical flashcards. The main goal of this project for me is to develop my JavaScript skills while also introduce myself to the Google Chrome Developer Environment.
